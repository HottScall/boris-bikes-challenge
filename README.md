<h2>The Client Brief</h2>

Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

<h2>User Stories</h2> 

Each User Story can befound in the Wiki, User Stories have been broken down into Objects and Messages and a basic communication flow between Objects and Messages has been drafted. 

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

Language: Ruby 
Testing Framework: Rspec 

<h2>Using the app</h2>

Clone this repo and run 'bundle install' then go into the boris-bikes-challenge directory type 'irb' into your command line. You can then set a variable to an instance of the DockingStation class and ensure it responds to the "release_bike" method, you can also create an instance of the Bike class and check that it responds to the 'working?' method.
